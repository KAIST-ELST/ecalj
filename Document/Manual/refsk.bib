	abstract = {The nonresonant tunneling regime for charge transfer across nanojunctions is critically dependent on the so-called β parameter, governing the exponential decay of the current as the length of the junction increases. For periodic materials, this parameter can be theoretically evaluated by computing the complex band structure {(CBS)—or} evanescent states—of the material forming the tunneling junction. In this work we present the calculation of the {CBS} for organic polymers using a variety of computational schemes, including standard local, semilocal, and hybrid-exchange density functionals, and many-body perturbation theory within the {GW} approximation. We compare the description of localization and β parameters among the adopted methods and with experimental data. We show that local and semilocal density functionals systematically underestimate the β parameter, while hybrid-exchange schemes partially correct for this discrepancy, resulting in a much better agreement with {GW} calculations and experiments. Self-consistency effects and self-energy representation issues of the {GW} corrections are discussed together with the use of Wannier functions to interpolate the electronic band structure.},

The band gap is measured by optical methods, and the Cu vacancy density and anion displacement parameter are determined by neutron scattering. Our data show that the band gap decreases for Cu-poor compositions, and the anion displacement is weakly dependent on the concentration of Cu vacancies. This is in apparent contradiction with ab initio calculations that always predict a larger band gap in presence of Cu vacancies. To shed light on this issue, we studied the overall dependence of the band gap on the anion displacement and on the concentration of Cu vacancies using a self-consistent {GW} approach and hybrid functionals, including a feedback mechanism that was recently proposed. Our calculations illustrate consistently the remarkable stability of the band gap of chalcopyrite semiconductors and explain the experimental observations by a coupled effect of Cu vacancies and lattice distortions within the feedback model.},

	abstract = {In a cubic topological insulator {(TI)}, there is a band inversion whereby the s-like Γ6c conduction band is below the p-like Γ7v+Γ8v valence bands by the “inversion energy” Δi{\textless}0. In {TIs} based on the zinc-blende structure such as {HgTe}, the Fermi energy intersects the degenerate Γ8v state so the insulating gap Eg between occupied and unoccupied bands vanishes. To achieve an insulating gap Eg{\textgreater}0 critical for {TI} applications, one often needs to resort to structural manipulations such as structural symmetry lowering (e.g., {Bi2Se3)}, strain, or quantum confinement. However, these methods have thus far opened an insulating gap of only {\textless}0.1 {eV.} Here we point out that there is an electronic rather than structural way to affect an insulating gap in a {TI:} if one can invert the spin-orbit levels and place Γ8v below Γ7v (“negative spin-orbit splitting”), one can realize band inversion (Δi{\textless}0) with a large insulating gap {(Eg} up to 0.5 {eV).} We outline design principles to create negative spin-orbit splitting: hybridization of d orbitals into p-like states. This general principle is illustrated in the “filled tetrahedral structures” {(FTS)} demonstrating via {GW} and density functional theory {(DFT)} calculations Eg{\textgreater}0 with Δi{\textless}0, albeit in a metastable form of {FTS.}},

It enables us to examine approximations behind the standard local density {approximation+U} and self-interaction corrected approaches. {QSGW} reproduces the experimental occupied 4f levels well, though the unoccupied levels are a little overestimated. Properties of the Fermi surface responsible for electronic properties-governed by the spd electrons-are in good agreement with available experimental data. {GdN} is predicted to be very near a critical point of a metal-insulator transition.},

This contrasts with the observed stability of the band gap of {CIS} solar panels under operating conditions, where a relatively large dispersion of values for u occurs. We solve this apparent paradox considering the coupled effect on the band gap of copper vacancies and lattice distortions. The correct treatment of d electrons in these materials requires going beyond density functional theory, and {GW} self-consistency is critical to evaluate the quasiparticle gap and the valence band maximum.},

Sci. 542 177). From surface free energy calculations, a phase diagram is constructed indicating the range of conditions over which each structure is most stable. These results are compared with Kubo and Nozoye's experimental observations. It is concluded that low Sr adatom coverage structures can only be explained if the surface is far from equilibrium. Intermediate coverage structures are stable only if the surface is in or very nearly in equilibrium with the strontium oxide.}
