Get symmetry line. syml.* from ctrl.*
====================================
In this directory, we have getsyml.py, which is based on the
seekpath(v.1.2.0, dec2016). https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/


============
Requirement:
 Numerical python
 spglib



============
Citations when we use.
  In addition to usual ecalj acknowledgement, folllowing citations are
  required when you use getsyml.py.

   1.Y. Hinuma, G. Pizzi, Y. Kumagai, F. Oba, I. Tanaka, 
     Band structure diagram paths based on crystallography, Comp. Mat. Sci. 128, 140 (2017) 
   2.You should also cite spglib that is an essential library used in the implementation.

============
See Lincence.txt for spglib and seekpath.

TODO:
   a.Modify lmchk to write required information to supply reasonable.
     For example, ndiv (mesh size along lines).
   b.Numerical accuracy of calculations. 
     np.set_printoptions(precision=16) is not meaningful since we read
     output of lmchk
