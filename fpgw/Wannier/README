===============================================
Maximally localized Wannier funciton generator.
  organized by t.kotani 2014July.
===============================================
After you do make at fpge/exec/, 
>make 
>make install
This copys binaries to your bin. 
In advance, look at Makefile first (set compilar, library and your bin).
genMLWF is the script to generate Wanneir function.
Required setting is written in the GWinput file.

Samples are:
 ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWFs     n1n2n3 4 4 4, rough but small
 ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWF     n1n2n3 10 10 10  
 ecalj/MATERIALS/SrVO3MLF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/FeMLWF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/NiOMLWF
. 

How to run samples.
At first, run job_band_nspin1 or job_band_nspin2 for reference.
It gives correct Fermi energy, and stored into bnds.* file
It is read by hmaxloc, called from genMLAWF.
Then run
>genMLWF -np 12 cu
where 12 is cores.

(1) Then run MATERIALS/CuMLWFs/bnds.gnu.cu.figMLWF
    Look into this script.
(2) Plot psi.xsf file. 
    This contains MaxLoc Wannier function.


==============================
Known bugs:
 * Range of plot looks not good.
 * Especially, vis_wan_ubound, vis_wan_lbound should be not integer.
   Probably, need to improve/(bug fix) wanplot.F.
 * xsf is cometimes inconvenient. But I have not tested no other format.

==============================
History:
This is from maxloc090910 (Miyake and kino).
visualizer at Kino's https://github.com/nim-hrkn/visualize
I checked it works for xsf format.
