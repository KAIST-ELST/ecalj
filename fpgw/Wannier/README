Maximally localized Wannier function generator. july2014
=============================================================
After you do make at fpge/exec/, 
>make 
>make install
This copys binaries to your bin. 
In advance, look at Makefile first (set compilar, library and your bin).
>genMLWF 
is the script to generate Wanneir function.
Required setting is written in the GWinput file.

Samples are:
 ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWFs    n1n2n3 4 4 4, rough but small within ~five minutes.
 ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWF     n1n2n3 10 10 10  
 ecalj/MATERIALS/SrVO3MLF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/FeMLWF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/NiOMLWF
. 

-----------------------------
How to run samples.
At first, 
run job_band_nspin1 or job_band_nspin2 for reference. 
(need syml.*)
>job_band_nspin1 cu -np 12
, where 12 means number of cores.
This gives correct Fermi energy, and stored into bnds.* file
It is read by hmaxloc, called from genMLWF.

Then run
>genMLWF -np 12 cu
where 12 is cores.

(1) Then run MATERIALS/CuMLWFs/bnds.gnu.cu.figMLWF
    Look into this script. This is for interpolated band.
(2) Plot psi.xsf file. 
    This contains MaxLoc Wannier function.
(3) grep Wan lwmat*
    This gives the matrix element of the Coulomb interaction and W-v.
    (off-diagonal elments are also calculated. Sorry, I have not yet
    document how to read this...)

==============================
Known bugs:
 * Range of plot looks not good;
   Especially, vis_wan_ubound, vis_wan_lbound should be not integer.
   Probably, need to improve/(bug fix) wanplot.F.
 * xsf is special for Xcrysden, thus it is sometimes inconvenient. 
   You need to use GUI of Xcrysden. 
   But I have not tested no other format.

==============================
History:
2009; maxloc090910 (T.Miyake)
2009; Its documentation and Visualizer at Kino's https://github.com/nim-hrkn/visualize
2014Aug; T.Kotani modified it so as to fit to latest ecalj.
2015jan: Sengwoo Jang's modification.

=====================================================================
Seungwoo's modification: To plot extract U, J parameters.

Modified fiels:
 hwmatK_MPI.F  print all matrix elements of W and frequency in eV.
 genMLWF  I added the "grep" commands in the last part to make files 
          containing v and W-v information.
          grep "Wannier" lwmatK1 > Coulomb_v
          grep "Wannier" lwmatK2 > Screening_W-v
new file

Cal_W.py:
  In this script, "W*****.dat = Coulomb_v + Screening_W-v" files are generated.
  (In other words, all matrix elements of W are generated.)
  For example, "W11234.dat" file contains "Spin up, <12|W|34> element".
  "W21234.dat" file contains "Spin down, <12|W|34> element".

Read_Sakakibara_W.py
  In  this script, "Sakakibara_W.dat" and plot files are genereated.
  "Sakakibara_W.dat" file contains static U, U', J, and J' (\omega = 0).

-------------------
Usage: Seungwoo's procedure for extracting Sakakibara's U,J parameters.

1) genMLWF

2) Modify inputs in "Cal_W.py"
- nwf : number of Wannier function
- ns : 2 for Spin_polar calculation, 1 for Non spin_polar calculation
Then fun ./Cal_W.py

3) Modify inputs in "Read_Sakakibara_W.py"
- system : name of the material
- nwf : number of Wannier function
- ns : 2 for Spin_polar calculation, 1 for Non spin_polar calculation
Then run ./Read_Sakakibara_W.py

===============================================================================

Caution:
Efermi shift:
 genMLWF requies bnds.${target} to read the Fermi energy.
 To generate it, we need to run job_band_* in advance.
(Or need to shift Ef by hand as follows in gnuplot script.)
 ----------------------------------------------------
 de = ((ef shown in "lmaxloc2") - (ef in llmf_ef(bnds.${target}))*13.605
 plot \
 "bnd1.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnd2.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnd3.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
